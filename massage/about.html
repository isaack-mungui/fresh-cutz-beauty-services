                <h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
                <p>Aromatherapy massage integrates essential oils into the massage experience. The use of essential oils dates back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, where they often gave scented massages and aromatic baths.
    
                Blending these two elements together promotes relaxation and may invigorate or energize you, depending on the types of scents your massage therapist chooses. Many therapists will consult with you first to learn which kinds of essential oils you prefer. For example, cypress is believed to relieve muscle pain, whereas tea tree is used to support the immune system.</p>

                    <h3>CranioSacral</h3>
                    For those looking for a gentle and non-invasive experience, craniosacral therapy may be the right fit. If you’re shy about taking off your clothes in front of a stranger, all the better. Practitioners of craniosacral therapy will often massage you fully clothed, with light and still movements.
    
                    Specialists in this area believe that light touch helps restore the central nervous system and improve irregular sleep patterns.

                    <h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
                    Deep tissue massage focuses on relieving severe muscle tension. It’s especially effective if you have musculoskeletal disorders, postural problems, or chronic muscle pain and tension. Massage therapists often use their knuckles, hands, and elbows to really dig in.
    
                    Avoid deep tissue massage if you have inflamed joints or ailments like lupus, because the vigorous nature of the massage could worsen a flare-up

                    <h3>Reiki</h3>
                    Reiki has its origins in 1800s Japan, where Dr. Usui popularized the practice and taught it to his students. Unlike most of the massage types listed here, using reiki doesn’t actually involve working tissue. Instead, practitioners gently place their hands above or on your body to transmit warmth and energy.

                    <h3>Reflexology</h3>
                    Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative medical practice involving the application of pressure to specific points on the feet, ears, and/or hands. This is done using thumb, finger, and hand massage techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on a pseudoscientific system of zones and reflex areas that purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work on the feet and hands causes a physical change to the supposedly related areas of the body.

                    <h3>Myofascial</h3>
                    Myofascial release is a type of physical therapy often used to treat myofascial pain syndrome. Myofascial pain syndrome is a chronic pain disorder caused by sensitivity and tightness in your myofascial tissues. These tissues surround and support the muscles throughout your body. The pain usually originates from specific points within your myofascial tissues called “trigger points.”
                    Myofascial release focuses on reducing pain by easing the tension and tightness in the trigger points. It’s not always easy to understand what trigger point is responsible for the pain. Localizing pain to a specific trigger point is very difficult. For that reason, myofascial release is often used over a broad area of muscle and tissue rather than at single points

                    <h3>Pregnancy Massage</h3>
                    Pregnancy massage is safe from the moment you’re pregnant but most practitioners would prefer to see you after the first trimester is over and you’ve had your first scan. Those first 12 weeks can be pretty miserable if you have sickness and tiredness and the thought of being massaged is probably far from your mind! Once you begin to feel a bit better and are reassured about the progress of the pregnancy, regular massage can be a real treat
