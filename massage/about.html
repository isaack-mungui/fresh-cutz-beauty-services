            <h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
            <p>Aromatherapy massage integrates essential oils into the massage experience. The use of essential oils dates back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, where they often gave scented massages and aromatic baths.

            Blending these two elements together promotes relaxation and may invigorate or energize you, depending on the types of scents your massage therapist chooses. Many therapists will consult with you first to learn which kinds of essential oils you prefer. For example, cypress is believed to relieve muscle pain, whereas tea tree is used to support the immune system.</p>

                <h3>CranioSacral</h3>
                For those looking for a gentle and non-invasive experience, craniosacral therapy may be the right fit. If you’re shy about taking off your clothes in front of a stranger, all the better. Practitioners of craniosacral therapy will often massage you fully clothed, with light and still movements.

                Specialists in this area believe that light touch helps restore the central nervous system and improve irregular sleep patterns.

                <h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
                Deep tissue massage focuses on relieving severe muscle tension. It’s especially effective if you have musculoskeletal disorders, postural problems, or chronic muscle pain and tension. Massage therapists often use their knuckles, hands, and elbows to really dig in.

                Avoid deep tissue massage if you have inflamed joints or ailments like lupus, because the vigorous nature of the massage could worsen a flare-up

                <h3>Reiki</h3>
                Reiki has its origins in 1800s Japan, where Dr. Usui popularized the practice and taught it to his students. Unlike most of the massage types listed here, using reiki doesn’t actually involve working tissue. Instead, practitioners gently place their hands above or on your body to transmit warmth and energy.
