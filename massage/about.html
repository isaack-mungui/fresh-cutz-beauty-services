        <h2 class="section_head">Aromatherapy</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="section_par">
          Aromatherapy massage integrates essential oils into the massage
          experience. The use of essential oils dates back thousands of years to
          ancient Egypt, where they often gave scented massages and aromatic
          baths. Blending these two elements together promotes relaxation and
          may invigorate or energize you, depending on the types of scents your
          massage therapist chooses. Many therapists will consult with you first
          to learn which kinds of essential oils you prefer. For example,
          cypress is believed to relieve muscle pain, whereas tea tree is used
          to support the immune system.

      <div id="CranioSacral" class="section">
        <h2>CranioSacral</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          For those looking for a gentle and non-invasive experience,
          craniosacral therapy may be the right fit. If you’re shy about taking
          off your clothes in front of a stranger, all the better. Practitioners
          of craniosacral therapy will often massage you fully clothed, with
          light and still movements. Specialists in this area believe that light
          touch helps restore the central nervous system and improve irregular
          sleep patterns.

      <div id="Deep" class="section">
        <h2>Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Deep tissue massage focuses on relieving severe muscle tension. It’s
          especially effective if you have musculoskeletal disorders, postural
          problems, or chronic muscle pain and tension. Massage therapists often
          use their knuckles, hands, and elbows to really dig in. Avoid deep
          tissue massage if you have inflamed joints or ailments like lupus,
          because the vigorous nature of the massage could worsen a flare-up

      <div id="reiki" class="section">
        <h2>Reiki</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reiki has its origins in 1800s Japan, where Dr. Usui popularized the
          practice and taught it to his students. Unlike most of the massage
          types listed here, using reiki doesn’t actually involve working
          tissue. Instead, practitioners gently place their hands above or on
          your body to transmit warmth and energy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Reflexology" class="section">
        <h2>Reflexology</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative medical
          practice involving the application of pressure to specific points on
          the feet, ears, and/or hands. This is done using thumb, finger, and
          hand massage techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based
          on a pseudoscientific system of zones and reflex areas that
          purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with
          the premise that such work on the feet and hands causes a physical
          change to the supposedly related areas of the body.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="myofascial" class="section">
        <h2>Myofascial</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Myofascial release is a type of physical therapy often used to treat
          myofascial pain syndrome. Myofascial pain syndrome is a chronic pain
          disorder caused by sensitivity and tightness in your myofascial
          tissues. These tissues surround and support the muscles throughout
          your body. The pain usually originates from specific points within
          your myofascial tissues called “trigger points.” Myofascial release
          focuses on reducing pain by easing the tension and tightness in the
          trigger points.

      <div id="pregnant" class="section">
        <h2>Pregnancy Massage</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Pregnancy massage is safe from the moment you’re pregnant but most
          practitioners would prefer to see you after the first trimester is
          over and you’ve had your first scan. Those first 12 weeks can be
          pretty miserable if you have sickness and tiredness and the thought of
          being massaged is probably far from your mind! Once you begin to feel
          a bit better and are reassured about the progress of the pregnancy,
          regular massage can be a real treat.
